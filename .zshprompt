# Create a custom dual-sided prompt, with a glyph on the left indicating
# the version control state and more information on the right that
# vanishes when anything is typed at the prompt.
#
# If the previous command returned nonzero, a header line
# displays the error code.
#
# In the HOME directory, as a special case, it will
# use ~/.files as the GIT_DIR.
#
# The glyph meanings:
#
#   $ (gray)    - the current directory is not tracked by git
#   % (green)   - the git checkout is clean
#   @ (orange)  - the git checkout contains unstaged changes/files
#   & (yellow)  - the git checkout contains staged changes/files
#   #           - the user is root, color as above.
#
# On the right-hand-side is listed:
#
#   - the root of the current git repos (cyan)
#   - the current branch name (color matches the glyph, bold)
#   - the current git action (if any) (white, bold)
#   - the subdirectory within the repos (cyan)
#
# Examples:
#
# 1) The current directory is ~/Documents, which is not under version control.
#
#     prompt: $                                       [~/Documents]
#     cursor:   ^
#
# 2) The current directory is ~/Projects/foo, which is managed by git. The
#    GIT_DIR is ~/Projects/foo/.git, the current branch is master, and the
#    checkout is clean. No action is currently being performed.
#
#     prompt: $                             [~/Projects/foo#master]
#     cursor:   ^
#
# 3) The current directory is ~/Projects/foo/bar/baz, which is managed by git.
#    The GIT_DIR is ~/Projects/foo/.git, the current branch is master, and the
#    checkout is clean. No action is currently being performed.
#
#     prompt: $                     [~/Projects/foo#master/bar/baz]
#     cursor:   ^
#
# 3) The current directory is ~/Projects/foo/bar/baz, which is managed by git.
#    The GIT_DIR is ~/Projects/foo/.git, the current branch is master, and the
#    checkout is clean. A `git rebase -i` is underway.
#
#     prompt: $           [~/Projects/foo#master(rebase-i)/bar/baz]
#     cursor:   ^
#
# 4) The current directory is ~/Projects/foo, which is managed by git. The
#    GIT_DIR is ~/Projects/foo/.git, the current branch is master, and the
#    checkout is contains unstaged changes.
#
#     prompt: @                             [~/Projects/foo#master]
#     cursor:   ^
#        
# 5) The current directory is ~/Projects/foo, which is managed by git. The
#    GIT_DIR is ~/Projects/foo/.git, the current branch is master, and the
#    checkout is contains staged changes.
#
#     prompt: &                             [~/Projects/foo#master]
#     cursor:   ^
#
# 6) The current directory is ~/Documents, which is not under version control.
#    The previous command, "foo -n bar", returned 5.
#
#     prompt:   $?=5 foo -n bar                               ERROR 
#             $                                       [~/Documents]
#     cursor:   ^
